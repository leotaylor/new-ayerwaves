            <p className="writing">
            AyerWaves was founded by Joshua Ayers in 2012 as "Josh's Underground".  It started as a radio show on WHAY 98.3FM in Whitley City, Kentucky. The two hour time slot was spent showcasing independent musicians from around the world.<br/>
    In 2015 the first AyerWaves live started as "Josh's Underground Acoustic Summer Concert Series". The event was held at Josh's yard in Oneida, Tennessee. The series consisted of seven concerts on 3 acres of land throughout the summer showcasing touring independent musicians and pairing them with a local performer. By the seventh concert the events were getting to large, so in 2015 Josh met with the owners of the Possum-Trot Western Themed Mountain Resort about bringing his event to their location. The two sides worked out a deal, and the AyerWaves became a small town Music Festival. <br/>
    The 2016 event known as the AyerWaves "1" was held on 46 acres with one stage outside in the town of Possum-Trot. The event had 20 performances over the two days. In 2017 AyerWaves "2"  rapidly expanded to 191 acres with four stages and 58 performances over four days headlined by <a href="http://www.darrellscott.com/" className="rainbow">Darrell Scott</a> and Home Grown Head. AyerWaves "3" was headlined by <a href="https://kellerwilliams.net/" className="rainbow">Keller Williams </a> and <a href="http://theemisunshine.com/" className="rainbow">Emi Sunshine</a>. AyerWaves "4" will surely entertain as the event continues to grow, and moves it primary location to middle Tennessee!<br/>
    AyerWaves Entertainment now helps organize and create for private, corporate, and community events. Joshua spends most of his time booking talent in Tennessee and Kentucky, and keeps a focus on sharing independent artist traveling the country. You can still hear the radio show every Monday night at 7pm EST on WHAY 98.3FM.
